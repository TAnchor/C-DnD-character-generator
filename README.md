# C-DnD-character-generator
This was made as a final project for COP 3223H - Honors Introduction to C Programming at the University of Central Florida during the Fall 2016 semester.

It uses user input to generate a 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons character.  Due to time constraints, it works off of a slightly simplified version of the D&D ruleset, so some parts, such as character proficiencies, do not exactly match the way they would work during the character creation process, but the major parts such as choosing a class and race, rolling ability scores, and calculating ability modifiers are present.
